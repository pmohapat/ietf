  <abstract>
    <t>A BGP route defines an association of an address prefix with an
     "exit point" from the current Autonomous System (AS). If the exit
     point  becomes unreachable due  to a  failure, the  route becomes
     invalid.  This  usually  triggers  an  exchange  of  BGP  control
     messages  after which a  new BGP  route for  the given  prefix is
     installed. However, connectivity can  be restored more quickly if
     the router  maintains precomputed BGP backup routes.  It can then
     switch to a  backup route immediately upon learning  that an exit
     point is unreachable, without needing to wait for the BGP control
     messages exchange.  This document specifies the  procedures to be
     used  by BGP to  maintain and  distribute the  precomputed backup
     routes.  Maintaining these  additional routes  is also  useful in
     promoting load balancing,  performing maintenance without causing
     traffic loss, and in reducing churn in the BGP control plane.</t>

  <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
   <t>Within an autonomous system, the availability of multiple routes
    to a given  destination, where each of the  routes has a different
    "exit point" from the local AS provides the following benefits:

    <list style="symbols">
     <t>Fault tolerance: Knowledge of  multiple "exit points" leads to
      reduction  in restoration  time after  failure. For  instance, a
      border  router   on  receiving   multiple  paths  to   the  same
      destination could decide to precompute a backup path and have it
      ready so  that when the  primary path becomes invalid,  it could
      use the  backup to  quickly restore connectivity.  Currently the
      restoration  time is  dependent on  BGP  protocol re-convergence
      that includes  a set of  withdraw and advertisement  messages in
      the network before a new best path can be learnt.</t>

     <t>Load balancing:  The availability  of multiple paths  to reach
      the same destination enables  load balancing of traffic provided
      the   paths   for   the   given  destination   satisfy   certain
      constraints.</t>

     <t>Churn  reduction:  The advertisement  of  multiple routes,  in
      certain  scenarios  (<xref  target="churn_red_section"></xref>),
      could lead  to less churn in  the network upon  a failure, since
      the presence of multiple paths  helps contain the failure to the
      local AS where the failure occurs.</t>

     <t>Graceful  maintenance:  The  availability  of  alternate  exit
      points allows one to bring down a router for maintenance without
      causing significant traffic loss.</t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>Unfortunately,  the  border routers  in  an  AS  do not  receive
    multiple paths for all prefixes. The reason is three-fold:

    <list style="symbols">
     <t>The  current BGP specification  <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>
      specifies  routers  to  advertise  only  the  best  path  for  a
      destination  to  speakers. The  availability  of multiple  paths
      requires  simultaneous  distribution of  multiple  routes for  a
      given prefix by a BGP speaker.  We refer to this property of the
      network as "path diversity".</t>

     <t>When a router selects an IBGP learnt path as best, it does not
      announce any  path for  that prefix to  IBGP though it  may have
      EBGP learnt  paths available. This loss of  information leads to
      added churn and increases convergence time if the preferred path
      goes away.   A mechanism to advertise the  best-external path to
      IBGP                         is                         proposed
      in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-best-external"></xref>.</t>

     <t>Most service  providers deploy  one of the  scaling techniques
      like   route   reflectors   <xref  target="RFC4456"></xref>   or
      confederations<xref  target="RFC5065"></xref> inside the  AS and
      avoid iBGP full mesh.  Thus  even when multiple paths exist, the
      aggregation  points (route  reflectors  or confederation  border
      routers)  advertise only  the best  path  (as per  the BGP  base
      protocol).</t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>As an effect of this  behavior, the ingress border routers to an
    AS  do  not receive  additional  paths  necessary  to provide  the
    benefits cited above: e.g. perform a local recovery during network
    failures or achieve load balancing in steady state across multiple
    exit points.</t>

   <t>The  mechanism to extend  BGP to  allow a  given BGP  speaker to
    advertise  multiple  paths  simultaneously  for a  destination  is
    defined  in  <xref  target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths"></xref>.   The
    current  draft describes  the use  of this  generic  technique and
    certain  additional procedures  and  implementation guidelines  to
    enable the above applications.</t>

   <t>More  specifically, this  document describes  extensions  to BGP
    decision process to  select backup paths in a  manner that ensures
    the  important property  of consistent  route selection  within an
    AS. It  also introduces  a new BGP  attribute, Edge_Discriminator,
    that border  routers should use to advertise  multiple EBGP learnt
    paths for a given destination.   To aid with better description of
    the applications, the draft illustrates certain use case scenarios
    for each.</t>

   <t>One implication of multiple path advertisement is the associated
    cost,  namely the  performance overhead  of processing  and memory
    overhead of  storing additional paths. It is  anticipated that the
    benefits listed above outweigh the cost in most scenarios. Be that
    as it  may, it is also  expected that there  will be configuration
    knobs provided to limit  the number of additional paths propagated
    within an AS.</t>

  <section anchor="basic_idea" title="Basic Idea">
   <t>This document proposes two main additions to the BGP procedures:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>The  decision process  is modified  to determine  backup paths
      along with  the best  path selection when  multiple paths  for a
      destination are available.</t>
     <t>In addition to using  these backup paths for fast connectivity
      restoration locally, BGP speakers  also advertise these paths to
      IBGP    to     increase    the    overall     path    diversity.
      <vspace      blankLines="1"      />      As      alluded      to
      in  <xref target="introduction"></xref>,  BGP speakers  that are
      the  aggregation  points  (router  reflectors  or  confederation
      border routers)  need to announce  backup paths to  increase the
      path  diversity  at  the  ingress  routers of  an  IBGP  network
      (see <xref  target="basic_rr_topology"></xref>). It may  also be
      useful, in  certain cases, for  the border routers  to advertise
      multiple paths  received via EBGP  for a destination when  it is
      redundantly connected and  is transparently passing the NEXT_HOP
      field    unchanged    instead   of    setting    it   to    self
      (see  <xref  target="ebgp_parallel_link_topology"></xref>).   To
      this end, the draft defines a new attribute, Edge_Discriminator,
      that  the  border  routers   should  advertise  to  ensure  path
      selection consistency.</t>
    </list>
   </t>
   <t>The following sections elaborate on these points.</t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="properties" title="Design Considerations">
   <section anchor="loop-freedom"
               title="Ensuring Loop-Free Path Selection in an AS">
    <t>It is critical that BGP  speakers within an AS have an eventual
     consistent  routing   view  of  destinations  and   do  not  make
     conflicting  decisions regarding best  path selection  that would
     otherwise  cause  forwarding  loops.   The current  BGP  protocol
     ensures this  property by defining a decision  process that takes
     the  attributes of  paths as  input  and determines  a degree  of
     preference  of  the paths  by  applying  a  constant function.  A
     consistent view of attributes  is disseminated through IBGP. Thus
     each  BGP speaker  within the  AS determines  the same  degree of
     preference  of the  paths  after applying  the constant  function
     independently. (The  one exception is where IGP  metric plays the
     tie breaking  role.  In this  case, different routers  may choose
     different next hops that are  closer to them; but loop freedom is
     guaranteed.).</t>

    <t>When the above mechanism is extended to select backup paths for
     the applications cited in  this document, it is equally important
     to maintain  the same consistency property for  the backup paths,
     i.e. there should be no loops created when routers use the backup
     path  in forwarding.   The rest  of  the document  goes into  the
     details of this for various scenarios.</t>

    <section anchor="single_path"
               title="Border routers announcing single path">
     <t>In  scenarios  where all  border  routers  advertise a  single
      external path (their best path or best-external path) into IBGP,
      a consistent routing  view of best path and  backup paths can be
      created across the AS with the current BGP selection rules.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="multiple_path"
               title="Border routers announcing multiple paths">
     <t>There are scenarios where border routers need to advertise the
      best  and backup EBGP  learnt paths  with NEXT_HOP  unchanged to
      IBGP.  If the border  router sets  next hop  to self,  the paths
      become  indistinguishable and  hence advertisement  of  only the
      best  path  is  sufficient.  An  example  scenario  is  depicted
      in <xref target="ebgp_parallel_link_topology"></xref>.</t>

     <t>By               using               the              add-path
      (<xref  target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths"></xref>) extensions, the
      border  routers   could  advertise  multiple   such  EBGP-learnt
      paths.  But doing  so  can potentially  create an  inconsistency
      between the paths that  the sending and receiving routers select
      for forwarding. In other words, the routers in the IBGP mesh can
      make independent  and separate decisions on  the route selection
      since some  of the values that  play a role in  the tie breaking
      steps of the decision process at the sender are not available to
      the rest of the BGP speakers of the AS. These are mainly (1) the
      interior cost, i.e.  the metric to reach the  external next hop,
      (2) BGP identifier of the peer,  (3) the peer IP address. Due to
      this reduction in information, there can be inconsistency in the
      routing view within an AS.</t>

     <t>Additionally,   <xref  target="RFC5004"></xref>   proposes  an
      extension to  avoid best path  transitions at the  border router
      between external  paths based on  a temporal order  of receiving
      the paths. This can also  create an inconsistency across the BGP
      speakers in the path selection.</t>

     <t>This document proposes two modifications to ensure consistency:
      <list style="letters">
       <t>Border  routers SHOULD  not  apply the  modification to  the
        selection rules as  proposed in <xref target="RFC5004"></xref>
        to avoid  best path  transitions for parallel  EBGP connection
        scenario  where  the  border  router  wishes  to  transitively
        transmit the NEXT_HOP value unchanged.</t>
       <t>To  overcome the  "information reduction"  problem described
        above,   the   document    specifies   an   attribute   called
        "Edge_Discriminator attribute" that  encodes the properties of
        each  path advertised  that  would otherwise  not be  included
        using  the   normal  attributes   in  a  BGP   UPDATE  message
        (see <xref target="ed_attribute"></xref>).</t>
      </list>
     </t>
    </section> <!-- for multiple-paths section -->

    <section anchor="confed_originator" title="Confederations">
     <t>When an AS employs confederations and the confederation border
      routers advertise multiple paths, there is no way to distinguish
      the originator (the actual  egress border router originating the
      prefix  to the  AS). To  ensure consistent  path  selection, the
      confederation  border routers  should  create the  ORIGINATOR_ID
      attribute  as described  in <xref  target="RFC4456"></xref> that
      carries the BGP identifier of the originator of the route to the
      local AS.</t>
    </section> <!-- for confederations section -->
   </section> <!-- for loop-freedom section -->

   <section anchor="path-invariance"
       title="Keeping Path Attributes Independent of Decision Process">
    <t>In  addition to  providing consistency  in path  selection, the
     solution  should satisfy  the following  important  property: the
     attributes associated with a  particular path should be invariant
     when a  different path is advertised or  withdrawn.  Other things
     being equal, it  is best to avoid the  potential churn introduced
     by the  feedback loops that  would occur if path  attributes were
     changed  at  the sender  as  a  result  of running  the  decision
     process. Thus  we do not  use any attributes with  semantics like
     "this  is my second  best path",  "this is  my third  best path",
     etc. This requirement precludes use  of marking or other means of
     indicating path ordering from sender's perspective since a change
     in the ordering requires re-advertising most of the paths.</t>

   <t>The         decision         process        as         described
    in  <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>  is followed  to  determine the
    overall best  path for a  destination. In addition,  the following
    rule SHOULD  be inserted  into the tie  breaking rules of  the BGP
    decision          process          after          step          f)
    (Sect.  9.1.2.2:  <xref  target="RFC4271"></xref>) and  after  the
    CLUSTER_LIST             length             check             step
    (Sect.  9: <xref target="RFC4456"></xref>):  a BGP  speaker SHOULD
    apply the tie  breaking steps (steps (e), (f),  and (g) as defined
    in <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>) with  the values encoded in the
    Edge_Discriminator attribute.</t>

   <t>Note  that the  above step  effectively compares  multiple paths
    that are  advertised by the  same egress border router  (since the
    BGP Identifier comparison step earlier would have eliminated paths
    from different egress border routers).</t>

   <t>Consider                       the                       network
    in <xref  target="ebgp_parallel_link_topology"></xref>.  r3 learns
    two paths P1 and P2 for destination a and wishes to advertise both
    to the iBGP mesh with  NEXT_HOP value unchanged. We need to ensure
    that both r3 and the other ingress routers in the network (r1, r4)
    make  a consistent  route selection  for the  best and  the backup
    paths for destination  a. The current tie breaking  rules [step f)
    comparison of  router ID or ORIGINATOR_ID and  step g) comparision
    of peering ID] are insufficient since at the ingress routers, both
    the paths will be received with  same values for each of the above
    parameters. Hence  an additional  tie breaking rule  comparing the
    original values  that the border  router itself used to  tie break
    the paths is required.</t>

   <t>Once the best path is  chosen, eliminate that path and all paths
    that have the same BGP  Identifier or NEXT_HOP as the choosen best
    path.  Note  that as specified  in <xref target="RFC4456"></xref>,
    if the  path carries the  ORIGINATOR_ID attribute, that  should be
    treated as the BGP Identifier.  Then rerun the best path procedure
    to  choose the  backup path.  The Tie  Breaking rules  of  the BGP
    decision process for second  best path selection are also modified
    as described above.</t>

   <t>This  mechanism can  be recursively  used to  calculate multiple
    backup paths if desired.</t>

  <section anchor="add_path_usage"
     title="Advertising Multiple Paths">
   <t>The                      technique                      outlined
    in   <xref  target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths"></xref>  is   used  to
    advertise best and backup  paths selected with the rules described
    in  <xref target="decision_process"></xref>.  For the  purposes of
    the applications cited in  this document, the "Path Identifier" is
    always treated as an opaque value with no semantics.</t>

   <t>When an egress border router chooses to advertise multiple paths
    learnt via EBGP to  IBGP, it SHOULD include the Edge_Discriminator
    attribute  as defined  in <xref  target="ed_attribute"></xref> for
    each of  the paths. The  attribute is constructed by  encoding the
    following properties of the path in TLV format:
    <list style="symbols">
     <t>The interior cost  to reach the NEXT_HOP of  the path, encoded
      with type 1.</t>
     <t>The BGP identifier of the EBGP peer from which it received the
      path, encoded with type 2.</t>
     <t>The peer address  of the EBGP peer from  which it received the

  <section anchor="deployment_consideration" 
             title="Deployment Considerations">
   <t> To ensure consistency in  path selection process across all the
    routers  in   an  AS,  the  deployment   considerations  from  the
    individual scaling  technology employed  in the network  should be
    inherited/applied.       For      example,       as      specified
    in  <xref target="RFC4456"></xref>,  the intra-cluster  IGP metric
    values  should  be  better   than  the  inter-cluster  IGP  metric
    values.       Similar       considerations      as       specified
    in <xref target="RFC5065"></xref> should be designed. </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Applications">
   <section title="Fast Connectivity Restoration">
    <t>Consider                       the                      network
     in  <xref   target="basic_rr_topology"></xref>.   All  4  routers
     indicated are  part of  a single  AS.  r3 and  r4 are  the border
     routers. Suppose r3  and r4 receive paths P1 and  P2 for the same
     prefix. Also assume that P1 is the preferred exit.</t>
    <t>There are two scenarios to consider:
     <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="case 1:"> P1 is  the preferred exit for all routers
       within   the  AS  (including   r4).   In   this  case,   if  r4
       follows  <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>,  r4 withdraws  P2 from
       the IBGP cloud.</t>
      <t hangText="case 2:"> P2 is preferred exit by r4. In this case,
       if  RR  follows <xref  target="RFC4271"></xref>,  RR gets  both
       paths, chooses one and sends it to r1.</t>
     </list>
    </t>
    <t>In both the cases above, 'r1' holds only a single path and only
     after  a  failure that  makes  P1  unavailable,  it receives  the
     alternate path (P2).</t>

    <t>However, if  both paths  were available to  'r1' and  all other
     border routers in the  network, then they could precompute backup
     paths  and keep  them ready  to restore  connectivity  upon being
     notified  of  a  failure.   The  failure  notification  could  be
     triggered  due  to a  link  failure  between  'r3' and  its  EBGP
     neighbor. This  failure could be  propagated to other  routers in
     r3's AS either  via IGP or BGP, resulting  in invalidating on all
     these routers  their primary paths  that were advertised  by that
     neighbor  to  r3 (and  that  r3  subsequently re-advertised  into
     IBGP).  Once these paths are invalidated, all these routers could
     switch to  the precomputed backup paths, without  waiting for any
     additional BGP advertisements.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Load Balancing">
    <t>In the above network, not  only can the additional path be used
     as a standby  best, but can also be used in  steady state to load
     balance traffic across the two exit points.</t>

     <t>'r5' is an EBGP peer of 'r1'. Today, if path P1 goes away, due
      to the non-availability of other paths, 'r1' sends a withdraw to
      r5  thus triggering  a  churn  in the  Internet.  This could  be
      significant  if there  are  multiple prefixes  involved. On  the
      other  hand,  if  r1  had  an  alternate  path  (with  identical
      attributes),  then this churn  could be  entirely avoided  by r1
      performing a local repair.</t>

     Current  BGP operations  treat  this  as a  sudden  link or  node
     failure  and try  to reconverge  that can  take in  the  order of
     seconds or minutes.</t>

    <t>With the  procedures defined in this  document, since alternate
     paths are  available at the  ingress routers, taking  down egress
     routers  from  the network  does  not  result  in a  network-wide
     reconvergence event.</t>

   <t>This  document   defines  a  new   BGP  optional  non-transitive
    attribute type, called Edge_Discriminator attribute. The attribute
    type is to be assigned by IANA.</t>

   <t>This   document   introduces   Attr   TLVs  within   the   above
    attribute. The type space for these  should be set up by IANA as a
    registry  of 1-octet  attr types.  These should  be assigned  on a
    first-come-first-serve basis.</t>

   <t>This document  defines the following  attr types that  should be
    assigned in the registry:
