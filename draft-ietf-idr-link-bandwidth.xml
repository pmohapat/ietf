  <section title="Introduction">
   <t>When  a BGP speaker  receives multiple  paths from  its internal
    peers, it could  select more than one path to  send traffic to. In
    doing  so,  it  might  be  useful  to  provide  the  speaker  with
    information that would help it distribute the traffic based on the
    bandwidth of the external  (DMZ) link. This document suggests that
    the external link bandwidth be  carried in the network using a new
    extended  community  <xref  target="RFC4360"></xref>  -  the  link
    bandwidth extended community.</t>

  <section anchor="link_bandwidth"
     title="Link Bandwidth Extended Community">
   <t>When a  BGP speaker receives  a route from an  external neighbor
    and  advertises this route  (via IBGP)  to internal  neighbors, as
    part of this advertisement the  router may carry the cost to reach
    the  external neighbor.  The  cost can  be  either configured  per
    neighbor or derived  from the bandwidth of the  link that connects
    the router  to a directly connected external  neighbor. This value
    is carried in the Link  Bandwidth Extended Community. No more than
    one  link bandwidth  extended  community SHALL  be  attached to  a
    route. Additionally,  if a route  is received with  link bandwidth
    extended  community and the  BGP speaker  sets itself  as next-hop
    while  announcing that route  to other  peers, the  link bandwidth
    extended community should be removed.</t>

   <t>The extended community is optional non-transitive.  The value of
    the  high-order octet  of the  extended Type  Field is  0x40.  The
    value of the  low-order octet of the extended  type field for this
    community is 0x04. The  value of the Global Administrator subfield
    in the Value  Field SHOULD represent the Autonomous  System of the
    router that attaches the  Link Bandwidth Community.  If four octet
    AS  numbering  scheme   is  used  <xref  target="RFC6793"></xref>,
    AS_TRANS should be used  in the Global Administrator subfield. The
    bandwidth of  the link is expressed  as 4 octets  in IEEE floating
    point format,  units being bytes  (not bits!)  per second.   It is
    carried  in   the  Local  Administrator  subfield   of  the  Value
    Field.</t>

  <section anchor="deploy" title="Deployment Considerations">
   <t>The usage of this community is restricted to the cases where BGP
    multipath can  be safely deployed.   If the path between  the load
    sharing router  and the exit point  is not tunneled,  then the IGP
    distance  between the load  balancing router  and the  exit points
    should be the same.</t>

   <t>If the path  between the load sharing router  and the exit point
    is tunneled,  then the  choice to use  this community is  a purely
    local matter to the load sharing router.</t>

   <t>In the context  of BGP/MPLS VPNs <xref target="RFC4364"></xref>,
    link  bandwidth community could  be used  to support  inbound load
    balancing for multihomed sites,  as follows.  Consider a site that
    is  connected to PE1  and PE2.  Both PE1  and PE2  would advertise
    VPN-IP  routes   associated  with  the   destinations  within  the
    site. One way  to enable other PEs to receive  all these routes is
    to require the RD of the  routes advertised by PE1 to be different
    from the  RD of the routes  advertised by PE2.   The VPN-IP routes
    advertised  by  PE1 should  carry  the  link bandwidth  community;
    likewise for  the VPN-IP routes advertised by  PE2.  The bandwidth
    value carried in the community  could be locally determined by PE1
    and PE2. Alternatively CEs of the site, when advertising IP routes
    to PE1  and PE2,  could add the  link bandwith community  to these
    advertisements, in which case PE1 and PE2, when originating VPN-IP
    routes,  would use  the bandwidth  value from  the IP  routes they
    received from  the CEs to  construct the link  bandwidth community
    carried by these VPN-IP routes.</t>

   <t>An ingress  PE, when sending traffic to  destinations within the
    site, can use the bandwidth  value carried in the community of the
    routes advertised  by PE1 and  PE2 to perform load  sharing, where
    some of the traffic would go via PE1, while other traffic would go
    via PE2.</t>

   <t>If there are  multiple paths to reach a  destination and if only
    some  of them  have  link bandwidth  community,  the load  sharing
    router  should not perform  unequal cost  load balancing  based on
    link bandwidths.</t>
